Abstract:
<br/>

The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) is caused by spatiotemporally congruent visuotactile stimulation which induces a sense of ownership over a fake limb. Even though proprioception seems to constrain the window of visuotactile integration, the role of proprioceptive signals in visuo-haptically induced RHI remains unclear. We tested two predictions of the Bayesian bottom-up model (Samad, Chung, & Shams, 2015); namely, that the strength of the illusion is inversely proportional to: 1) the distance separating rubber hand from the real one and 2) the precision of proprioceptive signals. To manipulate distance, we displaced participants’ hands from the starting position (16cm between hands) to either a position close to (8cm) or far from (24cm) the rubber hand, without the participants noticing. Before manipulation, we assessed proprioceptive abilities in a task requiring active reproduction of one’s arm’s position. Proprioceptive accuracy was operationalized as the mean absolute difference between target and reproduced positions. Multiple regression showed that neither proprioceptive accuracy, nor precision, nor their interaction were predictors of illusion strength – both for subjective and physiological measures. Bayes factor analyses revealed that the non-significant results reflected genuine null effects rather than experimental insensitivity. Our findings suggest the limited relevance of proprioceptive accuracy and distance – as long as the rubber hand is placed within peripersonal space – for the strength of visuo-haptically induced RHI. This highlights the need to nuance the bottom-up RHI model to identify better the conditions in which proprioceptive signals enter the multisensory integration processes, giving rise to feelings of body ownership.
