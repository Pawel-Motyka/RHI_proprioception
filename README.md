#### Abstract:

Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) is caused by spatiotemporally congruent visuotactile stimulation which induces a sense of ownership towards a fake limb. We tested two predictions of the Bayesian bottom-up model; namely, that the strength of the illusion is inversely proportional to: 1) the distance separating hands and 2) the precision of proprioceptive signals. To manipulate distance, we displaced participants’ hands to either a position close to (8cm) or far from (24cm) the rubber hand. Before manipulation, we assessed proprioceptive abilities in a task requiring active reproduction of one’s arm’s position. Proprioceptive precision was operationalised as inversely related to the variance of the estimations. Multiple regression showed that both for subjective and physiological measures neither distance, nor proprioceptive precision, nor their interaction were predictors of illusion strength. Bayes factor analyses provided evidence for null effects. Our findings suggest the limited relevance of proprioception for the strength of visuo-haptically induced RHI.

Performing data analysis:

The folder "_scripts" contains the codes used for data analysis. If you want to run your own preprocessing of electrodermal activity (performed in the section 6), please contact the corresponding author for the raw data. The folder "_dataframes" contains the preprocessed data saved as the outputs from particular sections of the code. This enables starting the analysis of preprocessed data at different sections of the code by reading the relevant data frames using the prepared lines at the beginnings of sections. For example, one could read "RHI_preprocessed_physiological_data(output_from_section_6)" at the beginning of section 7 and run the following section with the analysis of electrodermal activity data. The code along with its outputs and plots can be also viewed by downloading and opening the revelant html file from "_scripts". The folder "_figures" contains the plots from the main and supplementary results.
