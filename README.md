Abstract:
<br/>

Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) results from spatiotemporally congruent visuotactile stimulation which induces a sense of ownership over a fake limb. Yet, the role of proprioceptive information in the formation of the illusion remains unclear. Even though proprioception was indicated to constrain the window of visuotactile integration, the influence of online proprioceptive signals on RHI seems to be limited. For example, it has been shown that mechanical displacement of participant's hand during elicitation of the illusion (either towards or contrariwise to the rubber hand) does not influence the strength of the illusion.
To examine the role of proprioceptive signals in RHI, we displaced participant’s hand from the starting position (16cm between hands) either to the position close to (8cm) or far from (24cm) the rubber hand without the participant noticing. Prior to the experimental manipulation, we measured proprioceptive abilities in a task requiring active reproduction of arm’s position. We were particularly interested in proprioceptive accuracy (operationalized as a mean absolute difference between target and reproduced positions) and precision (inverse variance of reproduction errors). We predicted that precise proprioceptive signals should entail narrowed spatial window of visuotactile integration, resulting in attenuated illusion in the "far" but not in the "close" condition.
Multiple regression analysis showed that neither proprioceptive accuracy nor precision were predictors of the illusion strength. The interactions between accuracy/precision and experimental condition (far/close) were not significant as well. Bayesian Factor analyses proved that our results reflect genuine null effects rather than experimental insensitivity. Additionally, we found that proprioceptive accuracy and precision were very highly correlated which may question the need for the distinction between these two dimensions. In sum, our results show that online proprioceptive signals, pertaining to the exact localization of the hand within peripersonal space, are not relevant for multisensory integration processes giving rise to Rubber Hand Illusion.
